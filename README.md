YouTubeCSS (Dull Green) WIP
==========

Youtube CSS right now only for the watch page.

The colours can easily be changed to something else.

To be used with stylish. 

It's using the font cure.se so please download it before trying this skin.

Quick overview
==========

The skin is very focused on watching videos and not really anything else so bear that in mind when using it.

The video player has been changed in size so that it takes up the whole browser window.

Playlist controls are avalible when you hover over the upper most part of the browser window. (Sometimes when you try to open them over the video it can be a bit weird).

Comments have been removed since I myself don't see any need of having them.

The stuff below the video are set at a fixed height and the footer has been removed.

There is no dropdown menu on the topbar since most things you would access from there are avalible in the guide that is to the right.

I would like the guide to always display but haven't fixed that yet, so you'll have to press the button to extend it.

The scrollbar has been hidden to make for a larger viewing area and because of the fixed height it's not really needed.

All colours have been changed to (#1b1b1b, #222222, #2d2d2d, #3d3d3d #536751, #859c81)
